        <p class="text-muted pt-3">
          As the society is evolving, we are started relying more on online platforms than a physical one. There are thousands of online platforms been pop-up in last few years, which is good. No doubt online platforms are good but they work well with students who know the internet world in a better way. What happens when a kid joins online platform a continuous guide is required, because the internet world is quite new to him/her and she/he just want to know every pop-up comes in front of his/her eyes. So, we wanted to make something to help those kids by providing home tutor.
